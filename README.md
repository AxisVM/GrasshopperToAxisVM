# Grasshopper to AxisVM with *AxisVM Export*

The *AxisVM Export* Grasshopper plugin enables creating structural models and exports them to [AxisVM](www.axisvm.eu) structural analysis and design software. 

The *AxisVM Export* plugin communicates with AxisVM through its [COM interface](http://axisvm.eu/axisvm_products_programming.html). The export requires that AxisVM and Rhinoceros+Grasshopper programs are all installed on the same computer. After starting the export, AxisVM will automatically launch, showing the exported model.

Download the plugin, examples, and structure templates from [Food4Rhino](www.food4rhino.com/app/axisvm-export).

For installation and details read the [Wiki](https://github.com/AxisVM/GrasshopperToAxisVM/wiki).
