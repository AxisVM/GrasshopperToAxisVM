AxisVM Export uses the Rhinoceros RhinoCommon and Grasshopper libraries, which come with/for Rhinoceros 6.0. AxisVM Export depends fundamentally on the use of Rhinoceros and Grasshopper, and so Rhinocommon, Grasshopper, and all associated libraries are assumed to be "System Libraries" as defined by the GPL, and thus are excluded from this license.
